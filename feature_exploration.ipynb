    "There have been many projects that I've done in the past couple years surrounding exploring new datasets and developing metrics. Since the data that I used in these projects is confidential, I have adapted a couple of the projects I did to use publicily data (Kaggle's [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) Dataset)\n",

    "- Struck an iceberg on April 15th, 1912\n",
    "- 1,500 out of the 2,224 passengers and crew died (~67%)\n",

It is essentially an unsupervised machine learning model used specifically to identify anamolies in data. This script is a modified version of what I developed for that project.\n",
